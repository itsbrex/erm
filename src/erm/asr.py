# Substrings that mark a CUDA error we can recover from by retrying on CPU.
# faster-whisper (via ctranslate2) raises a bare RuntimeError when `device="auto"`
# picks the GPU but the CUDA wheels (libcublas, libcudnn) aren't installed — a very
# common setup on machines that have an NVIDIA GPU + driver but no CUDA runtime.
# This intentionally also matches other GPU-side CUDA failures (driver too old,
# out of memory): under `device="auto"` the user didn't demand the GPU, so any
# CUDA failure is better handled by silently retrying on CPU than by crashing.
# `cublas`/`cudnn` are substrings of the `lib*` names, and most messages also
# contain `cuda`, so this short list covers the observed failure strings.
