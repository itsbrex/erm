# Changelog

All notable changes to `erm` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Skill / agent install guidance prefers `uvx`.** The `erm` and `erm-tune`
  skills and `AGENTS.md` now recommend running erm via `uvx erm …` (no
  persistent install; uv caches the env after first run) and fall back to a
  Python venv (`python3 -m venv` + `pip install erm`) only where `uv` isn't
  available — replacing the prior `pipx install` / `pip install` recommendation.

### Added

- **First-class video I/O (`--video`)** — feed `erm` a video file and, by
  default, still get the cleaned audio only (`.wav`, today's behavior and the
  common "pull the audio out of this video" case). Pass `--video` to render the
  picture too: the output container is inferred from the input (`-o`'s extension
  overrides), and A/V stays in sync by construction (≤1 frame) — both streams
  render from the same edit timeline with the same frame-snapped crossfades, and
  the picture is conformed to the audio master's exact length.
  - **`--video-splice {crossfade,cut}`** — `crossfade` (default) dissolves each
    splice; `cut` makes hard jump cuts (both streams hard-concat, so they can't
    drift).
  - **`--vcodec` / `--crf` / `--preset`** — encoder knobs for the re-encoded
    picture (remove mode). `--mode silence` stream-copies the picture untouched
    (lossless, frame-exact). `--crf` reaches x264/x265, VP9, and AV1; `--preset`
    reaches x264/x265 and `libsvtav1`. When an explicitly-set value can't be
    honored by the chosen encoder, the CLI warns instead of dropping it silently.
  - **`--min-gap-ms` with `--video`** plays the removed footage *through* the
    injected pause (muted) instead of freezing the frame.
  - Audio is stored losslessly where the container allows (PCM in mov/mkv/avi);
    mp4 gets AAC 256k, webm gets Opus.
  - `validate` gains an **A/V-sync check** (video outputs only): the picture and
    audio streams must end within ~1 frame of each other.
  - See the [render-pipeline design doc](docs/render-pipeline.md) (Part 7) for
    the A/V-sync derivation.
- **`--add-fillers`** and **`--remove-fillers`** — adjust the pass-1 word list
  relative to the defaults instead of replacing it. `--fillers` still overrides
  the whole set; `--add-fillers "basically,like"` unions words on top of it, and
  `--remove-fillers "ah"` subtracts (removal wins over additions). Lets you keep
  the built-in stems and add or drop a couple of words without re-typing the
  full list.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-12

Render modes and pause spacing. Every new behavior is off by default — a default
run renders byte-identical audio to 0.2.x, and the only cut-list change is two
additive fields.

### Added

- **`--mode {remove,silence}`** — choose how detected cuts are applied.
  - `remove` (default): excise each cut and splice the survivors with
    crossfades (the existing behavior; the timeline shrinks).
  - `silence`: mute each cut span in place with a single ffmpeg `volume` pass,
    preserving the input's exact duration. Use it to keep A/V sync, multi-track
    alignment, and caption/transcript timestamps intact. The room-tone overlay
    fills the muted holes with the natural floor.
- **`--pad-pause-factor`** (with **`--pad-min-ms`** / **`--pad-max-ms`**) —
  *remove mode.* Retain a fraction of the silence each cut snapped over so tight
  splices keep a little breathing room. Context-aware and never adds time;
  default `0.0` removes the whole cut.
- **`--min-gap-ms`** — *remove mode.* Guarantee at least N ms between the two
  words flanking a splice, injecting silence when the natural pause is shorter.
  Default `0.0` injects nothing; injected silence is filled by room tone.
- Cut-list JSON fields `mode` and `injected_gap_s`; `silence` mode also reports
  `muted_s`.
- Public API: `render_silenced`, `pad_cuts`, `inject_min_gaps` (exported from
  `erm`).
- `docs/modes-and-padding.md` design note and a README **Modes** section.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- **Default `--model` is now `large-v3`** (was `medium.en`). The larger model
  catches more fillers and produces tighter word boundaries, improving detection
  quality out of the box. Override with `--model medium.en` / `--model small.en`
  for faster, lower-accuracy runs.
- `erm validate` now checks output duration per mode, reading `mode` /
  `injected_gap_s` from the cut list — `silence`: `output ≈ input`; `remove`:
  `output ≈ input − cuts + injected_gap_s`. Cut lists without these fields
  default to `remove` / `0.0` and validate exactly as before.
- `erm` warns when muted holes or injected gaps would be bare digital silence
  rather than a natural floor (`--mode silence` or `--min-gap-ms` combined with
  `--no-room-tone`).
- `erm` warns when `--pad-pause-factor` or `--min-gap-ms` are passed with
  `--mode silence`, since those knobs only shape remove-mode splices and are
  inert there.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Transcription gracefully falls back to CPU when the CUDA runtime libraries
  can't be loaded. `--device auto` (default) probes the GPU and falls back with
  a warning; `--device cpu` skips the probe entirely. (#3)

### Changed

- Expanded the test suite with CLI, integration, and pure-helper coverage. (#4)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Release tooling: `Makefile`, build/publish scripts, and GitHub Actions
  workflow. (#1)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Initial release. `erm` strips disfluencies (`um`, `uh`, `er`, `erm`, `ah`,
  `hmm`, `mhm`, `mm`, `uh-huh`, plus any-length elongations) from English
  speech using `faster-whisper` word timestamps, three audio-domain detectors
  for fillers Whisper hides, and ffmpeg for the cuts.
- Energy-minimum + zero-crossing boundary refinement, cut-size-scaled
  crossfades, optional denoising (`none` / `pre` / `post` / `hybrid`), and a
  looped room-tone undertone for a uniform noise floor.
- `erm validate` subcommand: container sanity, duration math, and a
  no-filler-survives invariant.
